## 🗓️ Learning Log

2025-10-19  
- Explored ternary operator for quick decisions
- Practiced declaring, printing, and using all primitive data types
# Java Data Types Example

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates how to use different primitive data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`) through a real-world example involving Netflix statistics.

## Code Functionality

The program prints:
- The number of countries Netflix is available in (using `byte`)
- The total unique titles worldwide (using `short`)
- The number of global subscribers (using `int`)
- The total streaming minutes in the last year (using `long`)
